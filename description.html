                    Neverwaste is a new rising business focused on solving
                    one of the main global concerns, plastic pollution.<br> What we
                    bring to the market is a device destined to shred plastic
                    bottles for easier disposal, easier use and, even more,
                    turning them into 3D printing material.

     Behind Neverwaste there is a team of five highschool students from „Ion Luca Caragiale” National College in Romania along with two coordinating teachers. Our main goal is to bring recycling into our everyday lives and we are willing to do our best in order to reach this goal, to build a cleaner future.
     What goes into Neverwaste? The building of our shredding devices and 3-D printing material require creativity, hardwork, innovation and dedication to fulfilling our customers’ needs and wants, resulting quality products at lower prices than any other similar products on the market and home-use efficiency for safe and easy plastic bottle recycling right in your home.

            Our vision                
            </p>            
            In the near future, Neverwaste shredding devices will be integrated everywhere.
            What will life look like with Neverwaste?
              As soon as possible, Neverwaste will be part of our everyday lives. Shredding plastic will be available at home, at work, at school and so on. Disposing of the shredded plastic will be just as easy through collecting centers conveniantly located for easy acces for our customers.     Even further, since 3D printing is no longer a thing of the future but a present reality, the plastic flakes resulted from shredding will be extruded and reintegrated on the market as 3D printing filaments.
